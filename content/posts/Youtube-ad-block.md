**Why did Google choose to enforce Youtube’s Terms & Conditions now & prevent ad blocking on the platform?**

One explanation is that YouTube aims to recover lost ad revenue resulting from the blocked ad views on the platform, yet this motive presents two key challenges:

* While significant and more prevalent among Gen Z & Millennials, statistics show that Ad Blocking growth has strongly decelerated since 2015. 

* Ad Blocking predominantly occurs on desktops, with its implementation on Android devices a lot less straightforward and virtually unfeasible on iOS/ connected TVs unless one sets up sophisticated router or VPN configurations.
    * Consequently, the monetization of YouTube Shorts, the rapidly growing video category on YouTube that rivals TikTok, remains largely unaffected by ad blocking, as most of its content is consumed on mobile devices.
Same goes with connected TVs. eMarketer statistics show that Connected TV are the fastest-growing medium for YouTube content consumption.

Ad Blocking arguably inflicts greater harm on Google's business model in the realm of Search, where average Cost Per Clicks (CPCs) are about ten times higher than on YouTube. If the primary goal is ad monetization, mandating users to whitelist YouTube fails to address the core problem of Ad Blocking across the entire advertising ecosystem.

# Why fight yesterday’s battle, now, in Q4 of 2023?
Looking at the Youtube Ad Blocking message, the second option for users is of course, to try Premium.
Google announced last November that Youtube Premium had reached 80 million subscribers, up from 30 million in 2020. Youtube Premium subscribers & fees are not specifically disclosed in the quarterly earnings calls (they are listed under Google other revenue, alongside Youtube TV revenue).

Google doesn't specifically disclose Youtube Premium revenue.

Assuming 80 Million subscribers will be paying the new price of 13.99/mo moving forward, Youtube Premium could be a 13B business for Google this year.
(An 80M subscribers estimate is probably low at the time of this post. However, the revenue per account is likely on the high side considering Google is still grandfathering older pricing for some and 13.99/user doesn't account for the discount on Family accounts).
In just 5 years (using $11.99/mo up to July 2023), it’s likely that Youtube Premium subscriptions have gone from representing 11% of Youtube’s total business to over 30%.

Earlier this year, When Netflix cracked down on password sharing, the company beat expectations in migrating freeloading users to paid accounts (+2.6M accounts in July 2023).
Is Google hoping to replicate a similar success in Q4-23?

In light of ad blocking trends, It’s hard to see how recouping the ad revenue loss alone would have been worth the amount of public backlash.
Interestingly, when asked about the new revenue potential of SGE (Search Generative Experience) during the Q3 earnings call, Google's CEO acknowledged the viability of subscriber based monetization for Youtube as an inspiration for the future of Search as well.

Q4 will show us how much the Youtube Paywall lifted Youtube ARPU's vs subscription revenue. The financial impact could be much greater on the latter.
