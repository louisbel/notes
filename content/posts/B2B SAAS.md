While researching best practices for SAAS landing pages, I found numerous SEO-optimized articles but few that offered concrete examples from leading companies. This guide aims to establish a set of guidelines organized into three main themes:*Value Proposition* *Credibility & Expertise*, *Navigation & interactivity*.

## Value Proposition

### Solution to a pain point
  
* Does the header of the landing page convey the uniqueness of the solution? Is the solution directly addressing a specific pain point that the buyer might be experiencing?

![image](/notes/images/1.1-Zapier.png)

*No more waiting for developers! Zapier has perfectly understood the pain point for marketers or sales leaders when they want to deploy a new marketing automation tactic but there is too much backlog on the dev team to implement it quickly.*

---

### Tangible brand identity

 * Is the brand identity conveyed through unique brand elements? Does the landing page look custom-built, or does it appear as a generic template?

 ![image](/notes/images/1.2-Kajabi.png)

*With its custom iconography, playfull illustrations and brand color highlights on URLs and CTA buttons, the Kajabi landing page creates a touchpoint with branding value.*

 ---

### Clear feature set

* Does the page list the software features clearly, helping buyers understand the full scope of the solution? It's less about listing every feature and more about highlighting what the company does best and where it focuses.

![image](/notes/images/1.3-Asana.gif)

*Asana uses a dropdown menu to allow users to expand product feature descriptions and preview an associated screenshot of the platform. The result is highly readable and interactive.*

---

### Platform screenshots

* Are there screenshots or demo videos that allow buyers to experience the product?

![image](/notes/images/1.4-Plivo.png)

*Plivo is being very selective with its screenshots, honing in on specific features as opposed to showing a broader UI.*

---

### Readability of screenshots

* Are the screenshots clear or busy? Complex images with too many colors and buttons can be overwhelming. Custom animations can help simplify the presentation.

![image](/notes/images/1.5-Melwater.png)

*The font size on Melwater's screenshots is not confortable to read.*

---

### Screenshot animation

* Are there animated screenshots or quick demo videos? They can effectively present the solution without taking up too much space.

![image](/notes/images/1.6-hotjar.gif)

*Hotjar uses a feature dropdown with associated screenrecording to present its platform. The result is highly engaging.*

---

### Compatibility & Integrations list

* Does the page clearly explain how the solution integrates with other tools in the buyer's marketing stack? Is it plug-and-play, or does it require custom development? How comprehensive is the integration?

![image](/notes/images/1.7-Mailchimp.gif)

*Mailchimp doesn't just show the logos of apps it integrates with, it has descriptions of the integration and a link to highly specific information on the benefits of each integration.*

---

### Competitor comparison

* Does the page include comparison matrices from third-party reviews? These help control the narrative and provide unbiased assessments that are critical in the buyer's decision-making process.

![image](/notes/images/1.8-Smartsheet.png)

*Smartsheet is using third party data from G2 to showcase how it stacks up with competitors.*

---

### Pricing access

* Is the pricing information easily accessible, especially in a competitive environment where others disclose their prices? Buyers need to understand how pricing scales.

![image](/notes/images/1.9-Hotjar.png)

*Hotjar discloses pricing on its pricing page but also clarifies that payment is not required for a trial.*

---

## Credibility & Expertise

###	Research Firm Praises	

* Does the page highlight top spots in research firm rankings like Gartner or Forrester? Such accolades can set a SaaS business apart. Other badges, like those from G2, also signal recognition.

![image](/notes/images/2.1-Thrive.gif)

*Thrive uses a dynamic carrousel of awards.*

---

###	Relevant customer logos	

* Are customer logos displayed? Working with prominent brands is a testament to success, but it's also important not to alienate midsize businesses if they are part of the target audience.

![image](/notes/images/2.2-Heap.png)

*Heap showcases a broad set of customers from multiple industries: insurance, retail, Direct to Consumer, SAAS...*

---

###	Visibility of logos	

* Are the logos recognizable or blending too much into the page design? Logos that are not easily identifiable use real estate for nothing.

![image](/notes/images/2.3-SurveyMonkey.png)

*SurveyMonkey's logo were recolored grey so they blend with the template and are difficult to identify.*

---

###	Customer Reviews	

* The validation from other users can make the product more appealing and credible, encouraging new customers to take the next step.

![image](/notes/images/2.4-Clicksend.png)

*Clicksend uses a Truspilot widget, making it easy to access more positive reviews about the service.*

---

###	Relevant job titles	

* Are the reviews from relevant job titles? For example, a positive review from a CFO will carry more weight for an accounting tool.

![image](/notes/images/2.5-Fincent.png)

*Fincent has a testimonial from an industry leader that carries a lot of weight.*

---

###	Reviews reinforcing the value proposition	

* Do the reviews align with the value proposition, strengthening credibility and making the promised benefits more believable?

![image](/notes/images/2.6-Remote.png)

*Remote's reviews directly echo its main value proposition.*

---


###	Genuine looking headshots	

* Are the headshots genuine and not overly professional? They should avoid looking like stock photography.

![image](/notes/images/2.7-SproutSocial.png)

*Sproutsocial's customer headshots are almost too polished. Are they from real customers or stock images?*

---

###	Abundance of positive reviews	

* Is there a substantial number of positive reviews displayed? More than 1-3 reviews can create an impression of broad appeal.

![image](/notes/images/2.8-Zapier.png)

*Zapier's dynamic carousel of positive reviews reinforces the broad appeal of the service.*

---

###	Links to case study	

* Are there links to case studies? Case studies provide real-world examples of how the product has successfully solved problems, demonstrating tangible results and value.

![image](/notes/images/2.9-Thrive.gif)

*In addition to a link to case studies, Thrive has video preview tiles with customers and KPIs.*

---

## Navigation & Interactivity

###	Cookie banner obstruction

* Is the cookie banner non-intrusive? Some cookie management tools can block critical information, especially on mobile.[^1]

![image](/notes/images/3.1-Sage.gif)

*Sage's cookie preferences pop-up hides most of the landing page.*

---

###	Landing page box in

* Does the landing page prevent users from navigating away? While limiting choice can increase conversion rates in some industries, it can be counter-intuitive for curious users, especially for products with long research cycles or when bidding on upper funnel keywords.

![image](/notes/images/3.2-Hibob-SiteNav1.png)

![image](/notes/images/3.2-Hibob-SiteNav2.png)

*Hibob's landing page doesn't allow for users to navigate to its regular site content via the header.*

---

###	Eye path alignment

* Is critical information, like the solution tagline, placed where users typically look first? Users generally look to the upper left quadrant first.

![image](/notes/images/3.3-Fivetran.png)

*Fivetran's landing page header strategically positions its tagline and CTA buttons on the left side of the page.*

---

###	Form field intentionality

* Are the all the form fields striclty necessary? Embedded forms with too many fields can deter users. Sites with trial options often require minimal input, like a Google sign-on.

![image](/notes/images/3.4-Clicksend.png)


*Clicksend's form is hosted on its platform subdomain and displays a platform status issues. The 6 fields form and the Captcha are a big ask.*

---


###	FAQ

* Mostly visible on landing pages that double as SEO pages, FAQ can be an elegant solution to address some of the common questions from prospects during the sales process.

![image](/notes/images/3.5-Asana.png)

*Thanks to its dropdown, Asana's FAQ doesn't take much space but it addresses important questions from prospects.*

---

###	On page animations

* Are animations used effectively? Pages with animations can be more engaging, encouraging users to consume more content.

![image](/notes/images/3.6-Monday.gif)

*Monday's feature set deploys as the user scroll downs.*

---

###	Page speed

* Is the page speed optimized? Slow pages have higher exit rates, and delays can significantly reduce conversions.  According to Google, for every second delay in mobile page load, conversions can fall by up to 20%.[^2]

![image](/notes/images/3.7-Monday.png)

*Despite a few blocking resources, Monday's landing page is blazing fast.*

---

###	CTA options

* Are there multiple call-to-action options? Some users might want to test the platform, while others may prefer to discuss their needs. Multiple paths can increase conversion rates.

![image](/notes/images/3.8-Fincent.png)

* Fincent employs a scarcity technique, similar to those used by hotel booking platforms, to convey the high demand and interest in its services.

![image](/notes/images/3.8-Infinity.png)

*Infinity has an embedded calendly booking widget on hits landing page to reduce friction.*
