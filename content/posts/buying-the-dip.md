# 2022: Apple's ITP: the end of Meta?

![image](/notes/images/Meta.png)


**09/01/2021 - 379.59 - 11/01/2022 - 94.33**
**=> 75% drop**

Apple's introduction of Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) significantly impacted Meta's stock price. [ITP](https://www.simoahava.com/privacy/intelligent-tracking-prevention-ios-14-ipados-14-safari-14/) restricted Meta's ability to track user activity across apps and websites, hindering its capacity for targeted advertising in the short term. In addition to ballooning AI expenses, the decline in ad revenue potential caused Meta's stock to tumble.

However, marketers who were using Facebook Ads Manager and optimizing campaigns at the time probably noticed a few things:
* Most sales and conversions were still occuring, the Meta tracking pixel just stopped crediting Meta Ads for it.
* The Conversion API feature (CAPI) was performing well at closing the attribution gap created by ITP.
* Claims of media budget exodus towards other platforms were overblown. There was still ROI on Meta.


# 2023: ChatGPT: a Google Search killer?

**Apr 1, 2022 - 140.01 - Mar 1, 2023 - 90.16**
**=> 36% drop**


When OpenAI released ChatGPT, it raised concerns that users might begin using the chatbot over traditional search engines. The long-term impact of AI on search is still uncertain, but 2023 highlighted that any significant changes would unfold gradually. Google holds a critical advantage in this area with its extensive access to user data, which is essential for training its large language models.

At the time, industry news showed us that:
* Interest for ChatGPT did not lead to significant market share gains for Bing.[^1]
* Google remained the biggest toll booth of the internet, with the ability to increase floor price in the auction.[^2]

Google might have been caught "flat-footed" on AI but the release of ChatGPT did not lead to a significant change in user behavior or advertiser spend.


# What do these two stories have in commun?

Both times, the market overreacted to industry rumors while the core advertising businesses of #Meta and #Goog remained robust. Other factors like buybacks, unexpected capital expenditures, and fiscal policies can also impact stock prices. However, when the market undervalues Meta or Google stocks without considering the strength of their advertising solutions, it likely presents a good opportunity for marketers to buy the dip.
